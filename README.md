# planet_orbits

## Installation
It is recommended to use a clean conda environment. You can choose the python version 
(for example 3.13). Replace VERSION with your choice in the following command:
```
conda create -n my_planet_orbits_env python==VERSION
conda activate my_planet_orbits_env
```
If you already have an environment, you just need to activate it.
After you have the environment, you can install stacking with:
```
git clone https://github.com/finestres-al-cel/planet_orbits.git
cd planet_orbits
pip install -e .
```
Optionally, you can add the path to planet_orbits to your bashrc:
```
export PLANET_ORBITS_BASE=<path to your planet_orbits repo>
```
Or you can add `planet_orbits/` to your `PYTHONPATH`. Both of these are optional and planet_orbits will work without them.
